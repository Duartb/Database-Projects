This project was done in the context of the **Advanced Databases** course at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. 

The goal of this project was to implement and optimize two databases containing information about music bands:
* a relational database in **PostgreSQL**;
* a document-oriented database in **MongoDB**.

The project is divided in three parts:

1. Design and implementation of a Bands database in PostgreSQL and MongoDB:
* Data preprocessing and insertion in the databases.
* ER and schema design.
* Comparison between PostgreSQL and MongoDB
2. Concurrency problems in PostgreSQL:
* Study of different types of anomolies.
* Study of different types of solutions to prevent such anomalies, like the use of locks or different isolation levels.
3. Database tunning and optimization
* Consideration of changes in data modelling to increase performance.
* Different indexation strategies implemented and compared.
* Query rewriting to improve performance.
